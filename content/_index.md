### Why a handbook over a repo wiki?

Repo wikis are great! However, with microservices we typically span multiple repos. 
For example, a separate front-end and back-end repo. Or a reusable library exists in a different repo.
Or you have a config server repo. 
In addition, project wikis usually describe the __how__, not the __what__ or __why__ - 
how to run a project locally, as opposed to what patterns and conventions we chose or why this choice was made.

### Why a handbook over my collection of bookmarks?

I too keep a collection of bookmarks, there's so many good resources on the web.
However, they're de-centralized - there's no common place where the team can find these resources.
They're also not necessarily directly applicable - or they may be misunderstood if it's not clear.
In addition, when you leave the project, we'll lose all your good resources.

If you have a great resource, add it to the handbook, even if it's just a link.
It would be even better if you describe how this pattern is applied to the project, 
while adding your link as a reference. 

### Why a handbook over a collaboration tool?

Collaboration tools can be a good place to put these resources if you have one. 
However, these tend to be disorganized, bloated, and are applied to an entire organization 
as opposed to being relevant to your team. This handbook is lightweight, free, fast, 
and more flexible to your team's needs.

If you have a mature and organized collection of resources known to the rest of the team,
you might not need the handbook. If you don't have such a collection, this handbook will be a great starting point.
